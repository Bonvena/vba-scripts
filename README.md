# vba-scripts
Various VBA scripts created to save time in the process of data analysis.

## TabCreatorbyCategory

This script employs Autofilter on a user-selected column with multiple nominal categories, with each tab of the worksheet a particular category. For instance, if your dataset has a column called color, with categories red, green, and blue, this script will create three new tabs for each color. This will leave you with four tabs: the original sheet plus three called "red", "green", and "blue". 

You can run the script multiple times to quickly categorize a worksheet.
